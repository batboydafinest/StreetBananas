        <p>We are Street Bananas, a fresh-fruit-selling black market. Welcome to our website. Most people wonder why is there a black market for fruits when you have cheap fruits from Costco or something. Well, fruits we sell are even cheaper than the ones in Costco.
        Fruits are one of all kinds of food which we gain nutrition from, such as Vitamin C, which help to repair and regenerate tissues and protect against heart disease. Plus, fresh fruits have all kinds of nice tastes which satisfy your taste buds. So there is no reason for you not to eat fresh fruits.
        However, grocery stores nowadays sets the price of fresh fruits way too high and they gain a ridiculously large amount of profit. That's not what we want to see. We came up with a solution, and it is Street Bananas. We are not a online black market, we are underground chain store spread worldwide. We provides extremely cheap and tasty fresh fruit to the people, so they can enjoy their healthy life style, and avoid getting tricked by other grocery stores.</p>
        <p><strong>We are Street Bananas. We ain't no ordinary black market.</strong></p>
